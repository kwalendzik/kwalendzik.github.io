"Picture this:" begins my elevator pitch for one of my many app ideas. Over the years, I've come up with quite a few, a couple not so bad, hopefully at least one potentially successful. Every once in a while, I'll mention them in passing to whoever will listen, in situations where they would allegedly come in handy. Having notoriously bad follow through, this is as far as I've gotten to actually making these visions a reality. 

Until recently, I've completely dismissed the idea that they would ever come to life for several reasons:
1. I have no money - for funding, engineers, or...anything really
2. I have no skills to execute the job for which I have no money to hire a professional
3. See above on lack of follow through

Since social mediea is creepily always eavesdropping and is undoubtedly a huge supporter of my ideas, I began seeing ads for Flatiron School in my Instagram feed. Mark Zuckerberg - is that you?

With that, I fell down the rabbit hole of researching boot camps and while Flatiron School was definitely the frontrunner, I wasn't sure that I was ready to commit to the rigorous course load and, well, the cost. Instead, I looked into free, learn-on-your-own options and decided to teach myself a thing or two.

This did not work for me. I'm truly in awe of anyone that is disciplined enough to succeed this way - I am not one of them and I'm at peace with it. It did, however, fuel my interest in development and motivate me to pursue a more structured option.

What I like about the Flatiron School concept:
* the weekly 1:1s to hold me accountable and/or keep me from going off the deep end
* the consistent and what I'm sure will be much needed technical support
* the pair programming to encourage collaboration and prevent me from being a total recluse
* the success rate of students and career services offered post graduation

So I decided to commit. While the pre-work itself was a roller coaster and I've fought the urge to quit multiple times, I've decided to also commit to myself and my potential for growth. And when the going gets tough, I'm going to channel my inner Elle Woods, bend and snap, and say...
